# First-Pageflex-Extension
This extension blocks a specified user from being able to logon to the website. It has a step by step guide to follow through that I created as well.


Methods:
1. DisplayName()
2. UniqueName()
(1 and 2 are required methods that the extension must override)
3. UserLogin_Before ()
(This method is called when the user tries to logon)
